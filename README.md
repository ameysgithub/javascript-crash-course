## What is JavaScript?
- High level, interpreted programming language - lot of abstraction, don't have deal with memory management, interpreted means don't need a compiler for running your program
- Conforms to the ECMAScript specification - JSript, ActionScript part of ECMAScript
- Multi-paradigm - OOP or functional code
- Runs on the client/browser as well as on the server (Node.js)
- JS adds interactivity to the front-end and back-end (Node.js)interacts with database

## Why Learn Javascript?
- programming language of the browser - PHP, C#, Java are powerful but run at the server-side
- build very interactive user interfaces with frameworks like React
- Used in building very fast server side and full stack applications using Node.js
- used in mobile development (React Native, NativeScript, Ionic)
- used in Desktop development(Electron JS)

We can have JS in the HTML file itself inside a script tag or in a separate file

## Variables & Data Types
three ways to declare variables
- var, global scope
- let, reassignment of value is possible
- const, cannot reassign
- if you are not going to reassign later, then use const

Primitive data types
- String
- numbers
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- symbols

- strings
    - concatenation
    - ES6 Template string format
    - methods and properties
    - 
## Arrays
Javascript is not statical typed
Arrays are zero based in every language
Arrays methods
    - push, add to end
    - unshift, add as 1st element
    - pop, removes last element
    - shift,
    - Array.isArray(arr) returns boolean
    - indexOf

## Object literals
- JSON format

## Loops
- for loops
- while loops
- looping over arrays, instead than for loop, better to use higher order array methods

## Conditionals
- '==' and '===' significance, '==' does not match the data type while '===' does
- simple if, if..else, and nested if..else if..else,
- operators: ||, &&
- ternary operator( ? : )
- switch statements

## functions
- declaration, caling a function with parameters, adding default values to parameters of function
- arrow functions introduced in ES6
- great to use with higher order array functions

## OOP

## Manipulating the DOM

### Events
- click, mouseout, hover
